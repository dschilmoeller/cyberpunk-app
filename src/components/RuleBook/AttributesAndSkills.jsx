                        Cyberpunks live and die by how cool they are. To reflect this, once per scene, they can use their Cool attribute in lieu of any other attribute in a roll. This can only be done if what they are doing is Fucking Awesome. The GM has final say on what can be subbed, but they are encouraged to be generous. Typically, the difficulty value of the roll is higher, or it requires two rolls (only one of which uses Cool) to succeed.

                <Grid item xs={12}><Typography variant='p'>The different categories are important - Streets skills are picked up on the job and actions involving them can generally be attempted with no points in the skill in question if the GM names one as a Parameter - anyone can try and lie to someone, or dodge a punch. There's just a limit to how well they can do so without training. Tekhne (your GM will lie and say this is Greek referring to 'some skill or craft required') refers to skills that require a bit more in the way of expertise, without being fully a specialty. If the GM declares one of these skills as a Parameter, a character can attempt to perform the task, but should tell the GM they have no points - their DV is usually one higher. Finally, Knowledge skills are more Academic specialties. When declared as a parameter, a character <b>cannot</b> even attempt the roll without at least one point in the skill in question.
