They need not be a musical performer; they can influence others through poetry, art, dance, or simply their physical presence. They could be a rockerâ€”or a cult leader.

                            Upon acquiring fans, a Rockerboy can get them to do things for them based on their rank in Charismatic impact.

                            <h1>Moto</h1>
                            A character with the Nomad role has the Moto ability. Nomads spend their whole lives behind the wheel and under the hoods of their cars, and as a consequence are significantly better drivers than most other people. Nomads add dice equal to 1/2 their rank to just about any vehicle test they make, including piloting, repairing, and inventing.

                            Nomads are part of a larger group, and have access to their family motor pool. For each rank, they have the option of either adding a stock vehicle of their rank or lower to the vehicles they can withdraw from the pool, or upgrading one of their existing vehicles. This is free of cost; a Nomad can add to their available vehicles and vehicle mods by acquiring them in some other way (theft, money, etc) as well.

                        <Grid item padding={.5}>
                            Nomads can only have one Family Vehicle out at a time. Generally, they can get someone to come and swap out a vehicle within 24 hours. If damaged, the family will repair the vehicle for 50% of the normal cost, but it will take a week or so. This is only for serious repairs - the nomad is expected to take care of bumper scuffs, paint scratches, and bullet holes on their own. If destroyed, the family will provide a replacement vehicle for about 50% of the replacement vehicles cost.

                            After Rank 7, Nomads are generally assumed to have a leadership role of some kind in the family - they can negotiate in play with the family to gain access to additional vehicles or have more than 1 vehicle in their possession at a time.

                            <h1>Credibility</h1>
                            A character with the Media role has Credibility. This ability affects how their stories are received by the public, as well as how large their audience is. It also allows the Media to pick up rumors passively, gain additional contacts, and assists in digging up new information.

                            <h3>Rumors:</h3>
                            Medias are deeply plugged into (often suspect) information networks, rumor mills, and bullshit factories. They have hosts of friends, contacts, acquaintances, and drinking buddies. Assuming they're not intentionally staying off grid, the GM should make a passive data collection roll for the Media periodically - they'll pick up all kinds of strange information over time, and it's the GM's call whether any of it relevant to the campaign generally or any job they're working more specifically.
                        </Grid>
                        <Grid item padding={.5} xs={12}>
                            This is the same kind of information that any character can find by hitting the street (ie. using Streetwise or Investigation to track down information), but requires no legwork on the Media's part. Like other characters, a Media can attempt to find information out intentionally.

                            Depending on their style, Medias roll Credibility, plus one of Cool + Streetwise (Citizen Reporter), Technique + Etiquette (Professional Journalism), or Appearance + Performance (Social Media Maven) in order to gather information. Their base DV is 9, and the result is based on the number of successes. The kinds of rumors they'll pick up should be influenced by their style - A citizen reporter is going to get an ants-eye view of the universe from low level workers, while the ProJo is going more likely to find a Deep Throat board memmber. The Social Media tends to find more out about the personal lives of people they're looking into. The base DV is lowered depending on how much time the Media is able to spend looking into a subject (person, place, product, corp, etc) - as a guideline, DV9 is about 15 minutes of digging. Spending a couple hours on a subject should be DV8, a whole day should be DV7, and a week DV6.

                            A character with the Medtech role has, not to put to fine a point on it, the knowledge and skills of a paramedic or doctor. In Cyberpumpkin, this makes them as much mechanics as doctors much of the time, and they rarely lack for demand of their skills. Medtechs get 1 point in one of three specialties when they advance their Medical Expertise Role Ability. These skills are rolled with an attribute for most tests; Medical Expertise is rarely rolled on its own.

                            Pharmaceuticals allows the Medtech to synthesize one of the below compounds with an Intelligence + Pharmaceuticals roll (DV 6) and some reagents. This will produce a number of doses of a given compound equal to the number of successes on the roll. The reagents have a street value of roughly 200 eddies. Pharmaceuticals typically require injection, though they can be prepared as a topical, pill, etc. possibly with a higher difficulty value as decided by the GM. Applying a dose takes a normal action; if the target is unwilling the Medtech can attempt to forcibly apply the medicine with a melee attack roll. Characters who are <b>not</b> Medtechs cannot administer Pharmaceuticals correctly - they cannot evaluate the correct dosage. Side effects may vary wildly.

                            A cryopump is a briefcase sized device containing a bodybag hooked to a pump and a few chemical containers. Once a willing (or unconscious) person is placed in the bag and the pump activated, they are bathed in a hypercool chemical slurry and the bag deflates around them. The person in the bag is put into stasis - they are unconscious and will no longer need to roll death saves as long as they are kept in the bag. The cryopump uses one charge per day of use, and has two charges as standard. The bag will be ruined if it suffers a lethal or aggravated wound of any kind. Surgery can be performed on the occupant through a special seal, reducing difficulties by 1. Refueling the Cryopump restores all used charges and uses materials with a street cost of roughly 200 eurobucks.

                            <h4>Cryotank:</h4>
                            A cryotank is a pod that can contain a grown adult. The name is something of a misnomer - it's a fully automated medical device that puts all nonessential functions into statis while accelerating vital healing functions. When placing someone into the tank, the Medtech makes an Intelligence + Cryogenics test at DV6; if successful the Cryotank will keep the person in stasis (see Cryopump) as long as the Cryotank is supplied with power. While in the tank, an occupant is considered unconscious, and heals far more rapidly than normal - all body saves to recover wounds are made with a -2 difficulty value. A cryotank is a substantial device, with an armor of 5, and can suffer 4 wounds before it fails. It makes excellent cover, honestly! Keeping a Cryotank running uses about materials with a street cost of roughly 200 eurobucks per week; up to about 6 months worth of material can be attached to a tank at a time. They can be installed in large vehicles, as well.

                            A Maker with Field Expertise is familiar with jury rigging, bypassing, or otherwise changing equipment in a hurry. A maker with this skill can attempt to jury rig a broken device. They roll Technique + Field Expertise against an items normal repair difficulty; if successful the device functions for 1 round / 10 minutes (combat / normal) for each success. Afterwards, the device is fully broken, and cannot be jury rigged again.

                            Makers can improve their equipment in various ways, applying a modification to armor, weapon, or vehicle. Items can generally benefit from only one modification at a time; Makers with 5 ranks in this skill can apply two upgrades to weapons. Upgrading an item requires the items base cost in additional materials (or an amount determined by GM for vehicle upgrades). The Maker rolls Technique + Upgrade expertise after a suitable amount of time tinkering. Failure consumes the materials to no benefit, while glitching upgrades the item but it is unlikely to work for very long.

                                Makers can manufacture items from materials costing roughly half an items purchase price. Fabrication usually requires blueprints of some kind (which generally cost rather more than the base item) or the Invention expertise skill as well as access to suitable tools and an interval of time to work on the device. Difficulty and time are based on the base cost of the item being created; Makers roll Technique + Fabrication Expertise at the end of each interval. Failure on this roll consumes 50% of the materials, while a glitch destroys all the Maker's raw materials. Critical glitches tend to destroy the workshop. Items requiring additional successes don't need to be succeeded at in one go; track successes each interval. Failures only occur if the total number of failures exceeds the number of successes.

                                A Maker can invent upgrades, modifications, or entirely new items. This skill is kept fairly open ended, but should fit in with the approximate technology and costs of existing items.

                                If satisfied, the GM will create rules and stats for the proposed item. The invention skill allows the production of a single prototype device; these tend to unbalance and break the game and as such are notoriously prone to failure as the GM realizes their mistake. Mass production requires the Fabrication skill. The roll to invent something is Intelligence + Invention Expertise with a DV determined by the GM.
