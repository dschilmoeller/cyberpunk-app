This is free of cost; a Nomad can add to their available vehicles and vehicle mods by acquiring them in some other way (theft, money, etc) as well.

                            Nomads can only have one Family Vehicle out at a time. Generally, they can get someone to come and swap out a vehicle within 24 hours. If damaged, the family will repair the vehicle for 50% of the normal cost, but it will take a week or so. This is only for serious repairs - the nomad is expected to take care of bumper scuffs, paint scratches, and bullet holes on their own. If destroyed, the family will provide a replacement vehicle for about 50% of the replacement vehicles cost.

                            After Rank 7, Nomads are generally assumed to have a leadership role of some kind in the family - they can negotiate in play with the family to gain access to additional vehicles or have more than 1 vehicle in their possession at a time.

                            A character with the Media role has Credibility. This ability affects how their stories are received by the public, as well as how large their audience is. It also allows the Media to pick up rumors passively, and assists in digging up new information, rumors, and the like.

                            Medias are deeply plugged into (often suspect) information networks, rumor mills, and bullshit factories. They have hosts of friends, contacts, acquaintances, and drinking buddies. Assuming they're not intentionally staying off grid, simply maintaining these networks requires the GM to make secret rolls to see what kinds of information makes its way into the Media's hot little hands each week. This is the same kind of information that any character can find by hitting the street (ie. using Streetwise or Investigation to track down information), but requires no legwork on the Media's part.

                            Like other characters, a Media can attempt to find information out intentionally. The passive DV is lower, but only occurs 1/week of in game time - they might hear a lot more, but only one item will likely be credible.

Medtechs get 1 point in one of three specialties when they advance their Medical Expertise Role Ability.

This will produce a number of doses of a given compound equal to the number of successes on the roll. The reagents have a street value of roughly 200 eddies. Pharmaceuticals typically require injection, though they can be prepared as a topical, pill, etc. possibly with a higher difficulty value as decided by the GM. Applying a dose takes a normal action; if the target is unwilling the Medtech can attempt to forcibly apply the medicine with a melee attack roll. Characters who are <b>not</b> Medtechs cannot administer Pharmaceuticals correctly - they cannot evaluate the correct dosage. They can certainly try, of course.

The person in the bag is put into stasis - they are unconscious and will no longer need to roll death saves as long as they are kept in the bag. The cryopump uses one charge per day of use, and has two charges as standard. The bag will be ruined if it suffers a lethal or aggravated wound of any kind. Surgery can be performed on the occupant through a special seal, reducing difficulties by 1. Refueling the Cryopump restores all used charges and uses materials with a street cost of roughly 200 eurobucks.

When placing someone into the tank, the Medtech makes an Intelligence + Cryogenics test at DV6; if successful the Cryotank will keep the person in stasis (see Cryopump) as long as the Cryotank is supplied with power. While in the tank, an occupant is considered unconscious, and heals far more rapidly than normal - all body saves to recover wounds are made with a -2 difficulty value. A cryotank is a substantial device, with an armor of 5, and can suffer 4 wounds before it fails. It makes excellent cover, honestly! Keeping a Cryotank running uses about materials with a street cost of roughly 200 eurobucks per week; up to about 6 months worth of material can be attached to a tank at a time. They can be installed in large vehicles, as well.

                            A character with the Maker role can jury rig, improve, manufacture, and invent items using their Craft Role Ability. Each rank of Maker gives 2 ranks to put into one of four specialties. These skills are rolled with an attribute for most tests; Craft is rarely rolled on its own.

                            A Maker with Field Expertise is familiar with jury rigging, bypassing, or otherwise changing equipment in a hurry. A maker with this skill can attempt to jury rig a broken device. They roll Technique + Field Expertise against an items normal repair difficulty; if successful the device functions for 1 round / 10 minutes (combat / normal) for each success. Afterwards, the device is fully broken, and cannot be jury rigged again.

                            Makers can improve their equipment in various ways, applying a modification to armor, weapon, or vehicle. Items can generally benefit from only one modification at a time; Makers with 5 ranks in this skill can apply two upgrades to weapons. Upgrading an item requires the items base cost in additional materials (or an amount determined by GM for vehicle upgrades). The Maker rolls Technique + Upgrade expertise after a suitable amount of time tinkering. Failure consumes the materials to no benefit, while glitching upgrades the item but it is unlikely to work for very long.

                                Makers can manufacture items from materials costing roughly half an items purchase price. Fabrication usually requires blueprints of some kind (which generally cost rather more than the base item) or the Invention expertise skill as well as access to suitable tools and an interval of time to work on the device. Difficulty and time are based on the base cost of the item being created; Makers roll Technique + Fabrication Expertise at the end of each interval. Failure on this roll consumes 50% of the materials, while a glitch destroys all the Maker's raw materials. Critical glitches tend to destroy the workshop. Items requiring additional successes don't need to be succeeded at in one go; track successes each interval. Failures only occur if the total number of failures exceeds the number of successes.

Pharmaceuticals typically require injection, though they can be prepared as a topical, pill, etc. possibly with a higher difficulty value as decided by the GM. Applying a dose takes a normal action; if the target is unwilling the Medtech can attempt to forcibly apply the medicine with a melee attack roll. Characters who are <b>not</b> Medtechs cannot administer Pharmaceuticals correctly - they cannot evaluate the correct dosage. They can certainly try, of course.

                        A cryopump is a briefcase sized device containing a bodybag hooked to a pump and a few chemical containers. Once a willing (or unconscious) person is placed in the bag and the pump activated, they are bathed in a hypercool chemical slurry and the bag deflates around them. The person in the bag is put into stasis - they are unconscious and will no longer need to roll death saves as long as they are kept in the bag. The cryopump uses one charge per day of use, and has two charges as standard. The bag will be ruined if it suffers a lethal or aggravated wound of any kind. Surgery can be performed on the occupant through a special seal, reducing difficulties by 1. Refueling the Cryopump restores all used charges and uses materials with a street cost of roughly 200 eurobucks.

                        A cryotank is a pod that can contain a grown adult. When placing someone into the tank, the Medtech makes an Intelligence + Cryogenics test at DV6; if successful the Cryotank will keep the person in stasis (see Cryopump) as long as the Cryotank is supplied with power. While in the tank, an occupant is considered unconscious, and heals far more rapidly than normal - all body saves to recover wounds are made with a -2 difficulty value. A cryotank is a substantial device, with an armor of 5, and can suffer 4 wounds before it fails. It makes excellent cover, honestly! Keeping a Cryotank running uses about materials with a street cost of roughly 200 eurobucks per week; up to about 6 months worth of material can be attached to a tank at a time. They can be installed in large vehicles, as well.

                        Makers can manufacture items from materials costing roughly half an items purchase price. Fabrication usually requires blueprints of some kind (which generally cost rather more than the base item) or the Invention expertise skill as well as access to suitable tools and an interval of time to work on the device. Difficulty and time are based on the base cost of the item being created; Makers roll Technique + Fabrication Expertise at the end of each interval. Failure on this roll consumes 50% of the materials, while a glitch destroys all the Maker's raw materials. Critical glitches tend to destroy the workshop. Items requiring additional successes don't need to be succeeded at in one go; track successes each interval. Failures only occur if the total number of failures exceeds the number of successes.

                        If satisfied, the GM will create rules and stats for the proposed item. The invention skill allows the production of a single prototype device; these tend to unbalance and break the game and as such are notoriously prone to failure as the GM realizes their mistake. Mass production requires the Fabrication skill. The roll to invent something is Intelligence + Invention Expertise with a DV determined by the GM.
